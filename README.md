# Emporium
An e-commerce framework using Elixir

Status
==============================
We are just getting started.  There's nothing usable yet

Philosophy
============
Provide a sophisticated, full-featured e-commerce framework that treats common features found in the wild as first-class citizens.

Subscriptions, recurring payments, customizable products, multi-currency/language, store credits, non-physical products e.g. services, downlaodable products (what's a better name for this?)
etc. are to be an integral part of the framework.

Extensibility is great but the act of taking advantage of it shouldn't be a symptom of an insufficient data model / too-small feature set.

That means pricing/inventory strategies (with respect to currency, product customization, etc.) need to be a core part of the data model.

Goals
